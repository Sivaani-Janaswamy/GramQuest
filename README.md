## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions: Get GramQuest Running Locally

Ready to contribute? Follow these simple steps to get your local development environment up and running:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/Sivaani-Janaswamy/GramQuest.git
    cd GramQuest
    ```

2.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

    *Note:* This command automatically creates the `/uploads` folder for file storage and a `.gitkeep` file to ensure its presence in your Git repository, thanks to a postinstall script.

3.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables (Backend):**

      * Create a `.env` file in the `/server` directory:
        ```bash
        touch server/.env
        ```
      * Open `.env` and add your MongoDB connection string and a secret key for JWT (JSON Web Tokens):
        ```
        MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
        JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
        ```
        **Important:** Keep your `JWT_SECRET` secure\!

## üöÄ Running the Application

Now that you've set everything up, let's launch GramQuest\! Open two separate terminal windows.

**Terminal 1: Backend**

```bash
cd server
npm start
```

This will start the backend server. You should see output indicating the server is running (typically on `http://localhost:5000` or a similar port).

**Terminal 2: Frontend**

```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

This will start the frontend development server. Usually, your browser will automatically open GramQuest (often at `http://localhost:5173`).
